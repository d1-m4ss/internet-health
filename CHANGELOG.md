# Changelog

The project is called **NetProbe Enhanced** (container, image, file and table names keep the upstream `netprobe` /
`np_` names so existing installations are unaffected).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-23

First public version.

- Per-target / per-IP history (`np_*` tables), state machine with confirmation, event log, CSV export.
- Readable Unraid notifications (diagnosis from all targets, icons, recovery durations) delivered by a host bridge
  over an authenticated queue; flood control (flap muting, per-hour limit for Down↔Degraded updates).
- DNS servers that stop answering are detected (`DOWN`) instead of being scored by elapsed time.
- Packet-loss report with episodes; custom `from`–`to` windows on every history endpoint; periods from 1 minute to a month.
- Compare mode (several metrics / targets / DNS servers on one chart).
- New UI: *NetProbe* and *UniFi* styles, Russian/English, Unraid → router → Internet path, uptime bar, accessibility
  (AA contrast, reduced motion, 390 px layout).
- Test-suite: unit/integration tests, a network-failure simulator, Playwright UI tests.
